# ABAP Code Learning Repository

This repository contains ABAP code that I created while learning and exploring various ABAP functionalities. Each program in this repository demonstrates different concepts, techniques, and best practices in ABAP development.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to document my learning progress in ABAP and to keep a version-controlled record of the code Iâ€™ve written. This allows me to review my work over time and track improvements as I continue studying.

## Contents

- **Basic Syntax**: Simple programs covering fundamental ABAP syntax and commands.
- **Data Operations**: Examples of data selection, manipulation, and internal table handling.
- **Advanced Features**: Programs that explore more advanced topics, such as joins, dynamic SQL, and error handling.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code and use any examples that may be helpful for your own learning. Each program is designed to be self-contained and can be run independently in an ABAP environment.

## Notes

- This repository is for personal learning purposes, so the code may not always follow best practices for production environments.
- Feedback or suggestions are welcome!
